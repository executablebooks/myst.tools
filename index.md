# Community-driven tools for the future of technical communication and publication

## MyST extends Markdown for technical and scientific communication

```{myst}
MyST makes <wiki:Markdown> more _extensible_ & **powerful** to support an
ecosystem of tools for computational narratives, technical documentation,
and open scientific communication.

:::{important}
# Our Values
We believe in a community-driven approach of open-source tools that are
composable and extensible.
